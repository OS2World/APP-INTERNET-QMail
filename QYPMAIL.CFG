/* Configuration file for QYPMAIL.  A Local delivery agent.
   Written by W.Rossi  10/7/96

   Each line of the file has the following syntax:
   <userid>,<mail directory>,<update INBOX>,<Command>
   Any line not containing the 3 comma delimeters is considered
   a comment.  

   Userid is the id of the user that this mail message is for.
   A user id of 'default' specifies the action to be taken for
   unknown users.  I.E. users not specifed specfically in this file.

   Mail directory is where the mail will be deposited.
  
   Update INBOX is either 'Y' or 'N', and specifies
   if an LAMAIL compatible INBOX.NDX file is to be updated.

   Command is a command to execute after mail is received.  The 
   macros %N and %F have the following meanings in the command:

   %N is replaced with the fully qualified file name of this mail 
   message.

   %F is replaced with the address the mail was from.

/* Delivery specifications for Bob -- Bob's mail is stored twice,
   once in d:\bob\mail, and then the command specifies it is to 
   be copied to d:\bob\mail\save.  This is useful because Bob 
   POPs his mail from us, but may sometime call to retrive lost
   messages, so we store an archive copy in d:\bob\save */
