QYPMAIL:

A local mail delivery agent for OS/2 sendmail.  QYPMAIL will deliver mail
locally on a per user basis.  Each user can then have their own 
subdirectory with their mail in it.  It is capable of generating (or not
generating) LAMAIL compatible index files.  Each user can also specify an
optional command to be executed upon receipt of mail.

Installation:

Put QYPMAIL.EXE in your \TCPIP\BIN directory.

Put QYPMAIL.CFG in your ETC directory.  Usually C:\MPTN\ETC or C:\TCPIP\ETC.
check the ETC environment variable.

Edit the sendmail.cf file to change the local delivery specification.  This
line start with Mlocal.  Change it to be the following:

Mlocal, P=d:\tcpip\bin\qypmail.exe, F=lsDFP,  S=10, R=20, A=qypmail $u

Edit the QYPMAIL.CFG file for your users.  The syntax of each line is
<userid>,<mail directory>,<Update Inbox (Y/N)>,<Command>.  Any line
not containing 3 commas is considered a comment.

The user default defines the behavior when mail arrives for an  otherwise
undefined user.  This could be used to automatically bounce mail for
example.

The Update Inbox filed must be either an uppercase 'Y' or 'N'.

The command in the command field is executed after the mail is written
to disk, and may contain the following 2 macros:

%N gets replaced with the fully qualified pathname of the file that
mail was stored in.

%F gets replaced with the sender's email address.

These marcos are case sensitive, so %n and %N are not the same!

The command filed may be left blank, but the comma delimeter is required.
So if no command is needed simply end the line there.  For example:

joe,d:\joe\mail,N,
